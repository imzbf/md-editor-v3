## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not report it publicly**.  
Instead, use the following secure channel:

- Email: [zbfcqtl@gmail.com](mailto:zbfcqtl@gmail.com)
- GitHub Security Advisories: [Report via GitHub](https://github.com/imzbf/md-editor-v3/security/advisories/new)

### What to Expect

- I will acknowledge your report as soon.
- Once fixed, I will release a patched version.
- If I determine the issue is not a security vulnerability, I will explain the reasoning.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure!
